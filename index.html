    today is the greatest, great things like art and today can be created through scraps<br />
    forensic diagrams - They're beautifully scary.  It's the relationship between space and the violent event and the record of it. <br />
    but the war is over our culture's image of the human soul.<br />
    dedicated to juta koether<br />
    and I started Ulysse with the words, 'I used to see the image upside down.' There's an image of a goat on the ground, like a fallen constellation,<br />
    The Psychoanalysis of Fire (1938) and The Poetics of Space (1958) can we do a bachelard reading group?<br />
    certain personality traits were found to correspond to concrete elements in a kind of psychoanalysis of the material world<br />
    There is nothing to be proud of, but happy.<br />
    Strange hours of our life<br />
    Desires managing me<br />
    It's about putting love where you've been told not to because you feel it so overwhelmingly<br />
    You can't appreciate the beauty of the world until you try to paint it<br />
    then i somersaulted into the bright arc of midday<br />
    and this transcendental moment was routinely followed by __<br />
    the aim of art is to tidy up ones inner and outer worlds<br />
    i make sentences from objects<br />
    when i was a kid we would holiday in the south of france, the house had a ghost and you could forage for pine nuts from the cones that fell into the garden.<br />
    with what we gleaned i took some back to my friend's house and we made pesto to have with gnocchi. i took those days for granted<br />
    i work from awkwardness - by that i mean i don't like to arrange things. if i stand in front of something, instead of arranging it, i arrange myself<br />
    today when i looked out of my window i spied an aeroplane moving peacefully like a gardener across grass.<br />have the birds always been this loud? do the insects always scream?<br />
    when you kill an ant, do you imagine its personality?<br />
    It all seemed to merge into this plane of consistency whose iteration was the cake I was baking<br />
